My name is Sathes Bala. I was previously working in the restaurant industry and found it awesome and a lot of fun. After about a year of working I found the job very tideous, felt like I wasn't learning anything new, and found it hard to challenge myself. I decided to change to a career where I'm constantly challenging myself and always learning something new. I joined Bitmaker Labs and completed an Immersive Web Development Coding Bootcamp. I'm currently improving my skills by trying new questions on LeetCode!

I find working on LeetCode problems a lot of fun due to how challenging it can get. It also trains my brain on how to solve problems. Lastly it showed me how important Pseudocode is.

My hobbies are travelling, exercising, and reading books. I spent a lot of time during quarantine reading books, two of my favorites are, How I built This - Guy Raz & Principles - Ray Dalio. My next travel destination is New York, I love a busy city!

# FAVORITE PROJECTS

https://codersathesbala.github.io/recipe-app/

While working in the restaurant industry I wanted to create a Web Application which is relatable to what I am doing right now. While working at a restaurant I often find myself in situations where I am constantly eating out, building this recipe app helped me find healthier dishes I could create on my own while working on my coding skills. This is the second React Project I have built, in the first one I used classes to get all the work done, during this Recipe App I decided to use Hooks instead in order to gain a better understanding. I love using hooks this project has cleaner code compared to my last project where I was using classes. React is awesome to use and I would love to continue using it!

An interactive Ruby on Rails app created by a group of​ five individuals,​ solving​ food​ waste​ in​Toronto.​ PlateAgain​ allows​ user to​ either​ log​in​ as​ a “provider”​ with​ an​ excess​ amount​ of​ food ​or an “acceptor”​ which is​ any​ sort​ of​ food​ bank​ or​​charity​ organization which​ would​ make​ the​food​ useful.​ ​Both​ these​ users​ can communicate​and​ ​​​view each​ other’s​ location​ in​ PlateAgain. This was my first app created with a group it was great to see what the process is like to work with other people and how the code I write can affect the whole group/project. Clean code is very effective throughout the creation process and learning to work with GitHub without overwriting other peoples work is a valuable lesson.

An​ interactive​ game​ created​ for​ entertainment, ​ ​NeoWallJump is a game inspired by Super Metroid +Matrix made during the GlobalJam 2018 Toronto 2018 (48 Hour Hack- athon). The objective of the game is to get to the top of the wall through wall jumps while avoiding the falilng objects. It was cool to work with skilled developers who have been in the industry for multiple years, their style of code and work ethic is something for me to learn from.
